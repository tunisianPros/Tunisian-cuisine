        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>4 whole onions</p>
        <p>5 whole tomatoes</p>
        <p>one whole garlic bulb</p>
        <p>or several whole garlic cloves with the peel</p>
        <p>4-5 whole green Anaheim pepper</p>
        <p>1/2 tsp salt</p>
        <p>1/4 tsp black pepper</p>
        <p>1-2-3 tbs Olive Oil</p>
        <p>Olives</p>
        <p>Tuna</p>
           <br>
           <br>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>*Note: We would like to mention before starting that as with many recipes,</p>
        <p>this is another one where the ingredient amounts and vegetable types can vary.</p>
        <p>Use this as a base recipe and adjust as you please. It can be made more or less spicy,more or less tomato-y, more or less garlic-y, etc</p>
        <p>Clean and dry the vegetables that have skin.</p>
        <p>Char your vegetables a few at a time.</p>
        <p>For the best flavor, do this over a charcoal grill.</p>
        <p>Turn the vegetables every so often to get an even char all the way around.</p>
        <p>*Note: If you do not have access to a charcoal grill,a gas grill would work as well.</p>
        <p>Once all your vegetables are charred, place in a plastic bag and tie it closed, or in a bowl covered with plastic wrap.</p>
        <p>This allows the vegetables to cool and sweat a bit which helps with the peeling process.</p>
        <p>Let them sit aside for about 10-20 mins.</p>
        <p>Begin peeling the outer skin and peel off of your vegetables.</p>
        <p>Remove any stems as well as any seeds you wish to omit.</p>
        <p>*Note: If the vegetables have sweat properly, the skins should be fairly easy to remove. A small knife can also be useful.</p>
        <p>Also, keep in mind, especially if using spicy peppers, that it may be helpful to wear kitchen gloves to avoid burning your fingers (and eyes!).</p>
        <p>Remove any seeds and ribs of your peppers if you do not want your final dish too spicy.</p>
        <p>Once all of your ingredients have been peeled, place a few vegetables at a time into</p>
        <p>a food processor and pulse until a little smooth but there are still some small chunks.</p>
        <p>Place each batch aside until you have processed all of your ingredients.</p>
        <p> Mix well and add salt and pepper to taste and adjust as needed.</p>
        <p>*Note: If you do not have a food processor, you can also use a fork and knife to cut your vegetables down,</p>
        <p>or a mortar and pestle to further mash them.Make it as chunky or smooth as you like.</p>
        <p>Place the finished dish on a serving plate and garnish with slices of hard boiled eggs, good quality tuna, olives, and a healthy drizzle of olive oil.</p>
        <p>Serve with fresh baguette or homemade bread and dig in!.</p>
