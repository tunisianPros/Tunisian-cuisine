        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p><b>For the pastry:</b></p>
        <p>2 boxes phyllo dough (chilled)</p>
        <p>1 cup pistachio (lightly toasted)</p>
        <p>(this can also be a half-half mix of pistachio/pine nuts)</p>
        <p>1 cup sugar</p>
        <p>1 tsp vanilla sugar (if can’t find, use regular vanilla extract)</p>
        <p>½ cup orange blossom water</p>
        <p>5 cups (lightly toasted almonds)</p>
        <p>Small bowl of melted butter</p>
        <p><b>For the simple syrup:</b></p>
        <p>3 cups sugar</p>
        <p>2 cups water</p>
        <p>¼ to ½  cup orange blossom water</p>
           <br>
           <br>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
       .  
        <p>Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees.</p>
        <p>In a pan, very lightly toast the nuts.</p>
        <p>*note: there should be very little browning and some spots should retain their raw color/texture.</p>
        <p>Remove them from the heat and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>While the nuts are cooling, make the simple syrup:In a medium pot,stir together water, sugar, lemon juice, and orange blossom water.</p>
        <p>Cook on medium low for 30 minutes and set aside.</p>
        <p>In a food processor, process almonds into coarse consistency (like thick couscous).</p>
        <p>Process the pistachios next, these should be more coarse than the almonds, for best results,chop them by hand with a knife.</p>
        <p>Place all the chopped nuts in a mixing bowl.</p>
        <p>Add sugar and vanilla sugar. Mix together with clean hands or a fork.</p>
        <p>Add the orange blossom water.</p>
        <p>Stir well and set aside.Unwrap phyllo dough at your work space.</p>
        <p>Cover with plastic and a kitchen towel to keep from drying out as you work.</p>
        <p>Brush the bottom of your pan with melted butter.</p>
        <p>Lay down your first two sheets of dough onto the tray.</p>
        <p>One on each side to fully cover your tray.Brush the sheets with melted butter.</p>
        <p>Continue to layer 2-3 sheets sheets of dough at a time making sure to brush each layer with</p>
        <p>more melted butter until you have 15 sheets of dough laid down finishing the last layer with melted butter.</p>
        <p>Empty the nut mixture onto the dough and gently spread it evenly with a fork to fully cover the dough.</p>
        <p>Begin the layering process again making sure to brush each layer with melted butter until you have</p>
        <p>another 15 sheets layered on top. Make sure to brush the last sheet evenly with the melted butter.</p>
        <p>Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the baklawa into diamond shapes and bake in the oven until golden brown</p>
        <p>Note: It is best to use a sharp knife for this and stand it up straight while cutting.</p>
        <p>To get even pieces, begin by cutting the whole tray in two halves.</p>
        <p>Then each half into half again, continue until you have about one inch columns or whatever desired size</p>
        <p> you prefer. Then cut individual diagonal lines down each column to complete your diamond shapes.</p>
        <p>Alternatively, you can also just cut baklawa into squares or rectangles.</p>
        <p>Take out of the oven and pour the warm simple syrup evenly over the entire thing.</p>
        <p>Let it sit overnight (or a few hours at least) to fully absorb the syrup then run a knife</p>
        <p>through your original cut marks to help you remove the baklawa pieces</p>
