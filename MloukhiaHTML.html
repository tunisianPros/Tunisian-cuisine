        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>1 packet of mloukhia (100g)</p>
        <p>neutral cooking oil</p>
        <p>3-4 bay leaves</p>
        <p>lamb shoulder chop (bone-in)</p>
        <p>2 tablespoons tabil</p>
        <p>1 tsp caraway</p>
        </p>1-2 tbsp homemade harissa (harissa arabi) and/or 1 tbsp tomato paste</p>
        <p>3 garlic cloves</p>
           <br>
           <br>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>Take the packet of mloukhia and place the contents in a large cooking pot on the stove.</p>
        <p>Add about 2 cups of neutral cooking oil. Mix and stir to get the lumps out.</p>
        <p>Then add about 2 liters of hot/boiling water but leave room at the top of the pot.</p>
        <p>Bring to a boil on med/high heat. Add bay leaves, then turn down pot to a low simmer and cover for about 2 hours. </p>
        <p> Meanwhile:Prepare the meat. (You can also do this the night before.)</p>
        <p>In a small bowl, mix tabil, caraway, harissa/tomato paste, ground pepper, and a pinch of salt.</p>
        <p>Then mash the garlic cloves to a paste in a mortar and pestle (or finely chop with a knife) and add to the other spices.</p>
        <p>Place lamb in a larger bowl and rub the spice mixture into the meat with a spoon.Cover and refrigerate (you can prepare this the day ahead and refrigerate overnight).</p>
        <p>After two hours, turn mloukhia pot back up and let it boil, then add the lamb in. Let it boil for a bit then turn down heat and let it simmer on low (for ~1.5-2 hours).At this point, the meat should be tender and starting to fall off the bone.' , 'The minute the water hits the mloukhia, it has a slimy consistency. The only way to get rid of this is to let it cook for a long time.</p>
        <p>(Total cooking time: ~3.5-5 hours)</p>
        <p>Serve with baguette and enjoy!</p>
