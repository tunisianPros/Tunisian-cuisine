var mloukhia =[
        {
        ingredients: ['1 packet of mloukhia (100g)','neutral cooking oil','3-4 bay leaves','1.25 lamb shoulder chop (bone-in)','2 tablespoons tabil', '1 tsp caraway','1-2 tbsp homemade harissa (harissa arabi) and/or 1 tbsp tomato paste', '3 garlic cloves'],
        preparation:['Take the packet of mloukhia and place the contents in a large cooking pot on the stove. Add about 2 cups of neutral cooking oil. Mix and stir to get the lumps out. Then add about 2 liters of hot/boiling water but leave room at the top of the pot. Bring to a boil on med/high heat. Add bay leaves, then turn down pot to a low simmer and cover for about 2 hours. Meanwhile:Prepare the meat. (You can also do this the night before.) In a small bowl, mix tabil, caraway, harissa/tomato paste, ground pepper, and a pinch of salt. Then mash the garlic cloves to a paste in a mortar and pestle (or finely chop with a knife) and add to the other spices. Place lamb in a larger bowl and rub the spice mixture into the meat with a spoon. Cover and refrigerate (you can prepare this the day ahead and refrigerate overnight). After two hours, turn mloukhia pot back up and let it boil, then add the lamb in. Let it boil for a bit then turn down heat and let it simmer on low (for ~1.5-2 hours).At this point, the meat should be tender and starting to fall off the bone. The minute the water hits the mloukhia, it has a slimy consistency. The only way to get rid of this is to let it cook for a long time. (Total cooking time: ~3.5-5 hours) Serve with baguette and enjoy!']

var couscous = [
    {
        ingredients: ['4 chicken thighs','1 medium onion', '1/3 cup olive oil + 2 tbsp for the Couscous','Water (1 liter or more for the sauce + 1/4 cup for the Couscous)','1.5 tbsp tomato paste', '2 heaping tsp turmeric','1.5 tsp chili flakes', '5-7 cloves of garlic', 'Salt & pepper','2/3 cup chickpeas','2 medium carrots', '1 large potato','1 zucchini','4 pieces of pumpkin','1 pepper + 4 more fried for garnish (optional)','2 cups Couscous'],
        preparation: ['Prepare the Couscous Sauce:','Start by cutting the onions into slices. Add the onions to the bottom pot of the steamer with the olive oil, chickpeas, chicken thighs, the tomato paste, and the spices. Put on medium high heat and mix well until the chicken is well seasoned and the tomato paste is dissolved. You might need to add splashes of water for this step. Let it cook for 5-10 minutes then add the rest of the water. It should cover the chicken thighs.Meanwhile, cut the vegetables into large chunks. (See the video for how I do it. I like cutting the carrots into long slices lengthwise, but you can cut however you like. Once the water comes to a boil, add one whole potato with the skin on. (This ensures that the potato doesn’t fall apart and become mush.) Add the carrots as well.', 'Prepare the Couscous','While the sauce is boiling, place your Couscous in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and season with salt and mix it with your hands/fingers. Make sure that each small ball is coated with the oil. This makes the Couscous not stick together while steaming. Add approximately 1/4 cup of water and mix again. The couscous should be damp to the touch (not soaked). Set aside .', 'Once the sauce has boiled for about 10-15 min, add the zucchini and pumpkin. Place the Couscous in the steamer pot on top of the sauce and let it steam for 20-30 min.','Once all the vegetables and chicken are cooked, remove the Couscous and put it in a large bowl. Then, using the steamer pot, pour the sauce in it. This should separate the sauce and the vegetables. The sauce goes with the Couscous and the vegetables remain in the pot.','Mix lightly with a large spoon then cover the bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes. Uncover, and mix again and see if more liquid needs to be added. I recommend you taste the Couscous for this step. Once it is ready, serve in a shallow bowl with a piece of chicken, pumpkin, a potato slice, carrots, zucchini, and a spoonful of chickpeas. You can top it off with a fried pepper. Serve hot and enjoy!','TIP: this dish is paired perfectly with pomegranate seeds if you like sweet & savory pairings.']

        preparation:['Place chickpeas in a large bowl and add water. Allow the chickpeas to soak overnight. Make sure chickpeas are fully covered by the water.Pour the chickpeas and the water they soaked in into a pot and bring to a boil. Once boiling, reduce the heat to low, partially cover and allow to simmer until very tender. Skim any foam that may develop at the surface.*Note: This may take 30-40 minutes, but you will know they are done when you can easily smash them between your fingers and some of the skins start to separate from the chickpeas.Once the chickpeas are fully cooked, add the salt, pepper, and cumin. Stir and remove from heat.Serve hot in a bowl and add your preferred garnish. You can go simple and traditional with just pepper flakes and a drizzle of olive oil. Or go all out and add the stale bread to soak up the broth, a generous spoonful of harissa, some good quality Tunisian tuna, and a poached egg to top it all off.']

var tajine=[
    {
        ingredients:['1 lb chicken or lamb cut into small cubes about ¼ inch in size','1 cup potato peeled and chopped into ¼ inch cubes','Garlic 4-6 cloves',' ¼ cup oil or enough to fully cover the bottom of your pot','Water','1 tbs ras el hanout spice mixture','1 tsp tomato paste','¼ tsp black pepper','1 tsp salt','¼ tsp cayenne powder','1 tsp turmeric powder','One bunch parsley one bunch very finely chopped','1 cup frozen peas thawed','8-10 Eggs','⅓ cup dried bread crumbs','½ cup cheese'],
        preparation:['Preheat your oven to 300 degrees F','Using a mortar and pestle, mash together your garlic and spice mix.In a small saucepan, add your oil,  chicken, garlic and spice mixture, tomato paste, black pepper, salt, cayenne pepper, and turmeric. Saute on about medium high for a few minutes. Add enough water to cover the chicken, reduce the heat to low, cover and let simmer until the liquid has reduced by about ½ and the chicken is fully cooked. Set it aside and allow to cool.Note: By the end of cooking time for the chicken, it is ok and should look like there is more chicken than sauce. The sauce will be quite oily and this is what you want, so do not drain the oil as it is essential to the final outcome of the dish. Also, this is the only point to taste for salt/seasoning since later the mixture will have raw eggs. The sauce should be salty enough but try to avoid adding too much as the parmesan cheese will add a good amount of saltiness as well. In in small frying pan, fry your potatoes until just very lightly golden brown on the edges, the centers should still be pretty white. Set aside to cool on a paper towel lined plate. In a large bowl, whisk together 8 whole eggs. Add your parsley, potatoes, peas, parmesan cheese, bread crumbs, and chicken mixture and gently fold all the ingredients together.Note: You are looking for a thick but still runny consistency. Similar to other quiches. If you find it’s too thick, feel free to whisk together one or two more eggs and add them to the mixture. If you find it is too runny, feel free to add in more bread crumbs just a spoonful at a time. With ours, we ended up adding two more eggs for a total of 10. Pour your mixture into a baking dish. Bake for 30-50 minutes or until the center has set and the edges are golden brown. Note: baking time will vary depending on your oven and the size of baking dish used. A square pan about 10x10 inches and 1-3 inches high is usually used to get the square tagine shape. A round pan, like the one we used is also fine but just keep in mind it will take longer to cook the smaller the dish you use. Remove from oven and allow to cool.  Cut into squares or any desired shape and serve.']

var brik=[
    {
    ingredients:['malsouka (or lumpia or egg roll wrappers)','eggs (one for each brik you wish to make)','Vegetable oil','1 bunch parsley chopped','one bunch green onions or 1 medium white onion chopped','1-2 tbs cheese','1-2 cans tuna drained well','pinch of salt and black pepper','Optional fillings:','1-2 large russet potatoes, boiled and mashed','Capers'],
    preparation:['Separate and fold the malsouka (or lumpia wrappers) into triangle shapes. Since these are round, the easiest way is to fold in 4 edges to make somewhat of a square, then fold one corner of the square across to the opposite one to create a triangle.  Set these aside and keep covered well until ready to use so they do not dry out. In a bowl mix together all the other ingredients and set aside.Heat a frying pan with about a half inch of vegetable oil on just over medium heat and make sure its hot enough to fry before you start assembling your brik.In a plate, place your square wrapper, and line two of the edges with the parsley/tuna mixture making sure they connect. This will serve as a border to keep the egg in place. Sprinkle the center of the wrapper with a little salt and pepper and carefully crack your egg right on top of the salt and pepper. Fold over the top of the wrapper and using the plate, gently slide it into the oil. Use a spoon to gently press the brik closed and to spoon some of the hot oil onto the side not submerged into the oil. While it cooks on one side, you can make a second brik and cook them at the same time.Let the brik fry for about 2-3 minutes or until a nice golden brown before flipping to the other side and repeat.*Note: Tunisian brik is traditionally made with a runny egg. To achieve this, you will want to be careful how long you leave the brik in the frying oil, and it will take some trial and error. If you prefer a hard cooked egg, leave it to fry longer.Remove the brik and place on a paper towel lined plate and continue frying as many briks as you wish to make.When finished, place on a serving dish and garnish with lemon or lime wedges (to squeeze over) and serve immediately. Enjoy!']

        preparation:['*Note: We would like to mention before starting that as with many recipes, this is another one where the ingredient amounts and vegetable types can vary. Use this as a base recipe and adjust as you please. It can be made more or less spicy, more or less tomato-y, more or less garlic-y, etc. Clean and dry the vegetables that have skin. Char your vegetables a few at a time. For the best flavor, do this over a charcoal grill. Turn the vegetables every so often to get an even char all the way around.*Note: If you do not have access to a charcoal grill, a gas grill would work as well. Other methods for charring vegetables are available also such as straight over a gas stove flame, or under the broiler component of your oven. Just be careful with whichever method you choose.Once all your vegetables are charred, place in a plastic bag and tie it closed, or in a bowl covered with plastic wrap. This allows the vegetables to cool and sweat a bit which helps with the peeling process. Let them sit aside for about 10-20 mins.Begin peeling the outer skin and peel off of your vegetables. Remove any stems as well as any seeds you wish to omit.*Note: If the vegetables have sweat properly, the skins should be fairly easy to remove; a small knife can also be useful. Also, keep in mind, especially if using spicy peppers, that it may be helpful to wear kitchen gloves to avoid burning your fingers (and eyes!). Remove any seeds and ribs of your peppers if you do not want your final dish too spicy.Once all of your ingredients have been peeled, place a few vegetables at a time into a food processor and pulse until a little smooth but there are still some small chunks. Place each batch aside until you have processed all of your ingredients. Mix well and add salt and pepper to taste and adjust as needed. *Note: If you do not have a food processor, you can also use a fork and knife to cut your vegetables down, or a mortar and pestle to further mash them. Make it as chunky or smooth as you like.Place the finished dish on a serving plate and garnish with slices of hard boiled eggs, good quality tuna, olives, and a healthy drizzle of olive oil. Serve with fresh baguette or homemade bread and dig in!']

    preparation:["Pre-heat your oven to 350 degrees. In a pan, very lightly toast the nuts. *note: there should be very little browning and some spots should retain their raw color/texture).Remove them from the heat and allow to cool.While the nuts are cooling, make the simple syrup:In a medium pot, stir together water, sugar, lemon juice, and orange blossom water.Cook on medium low for 30 minutes and set aside. In a food processor, process almonds into coarse consistency (like thick couscous).Process the pistachios next, these should be more coarse than the almonds, for best results, chop them by hand with a knife.Place all the chopped nuts in a mixing bowl. Add sugar and vanilla sugar. Mix together with clean hands or a fork. Add the orange blossom water. Stir well and set aside.Unwrap phyllo dough at your work space. Cover with plastic and a kitchen towel to keep from drying out as you work.Brush the bottom of your pan with melted butter. Lay down your first two sheets of dough onto the tray. One on each side to fully cover your tray. Brush the sheets with melted butter.Continue to layer 2-3 sheets sheets of dough at a time making sure to brush each layer with more melted butter until you have 15 sheets of dough laid down finishing the last layer with melted butter.Empty the nut mixture onto the dough and gently spread it evenly with a fork to fully cover the dough.Begin the layering process again making sure to brush each layer with melted butter until you have another 15 sheets layered on top. Make sure to brush the last sheet evenly with the melted butter.Using a sharp knife, carefully cut the baklawa into diamond shapes and bake in the oven until golden brown.Note: It is best to use a sharp knife for this and stand it up straight while cutting. To get even pieces, begin by cutting the whole tray in two halves. Then each half into half again, continue until you have about one inch columns or whatever desired size you prefer. Then cut individual diagonal lines down each column to complete your diamond shapes. Alternatively, you can also just cut baklawa into squares or rectangles.Take out of the oven and pour the warm simple syrup evenly over the entire thing.Let it sit overnight (or a few hours at least) to fully absorb the syrup then run a knife through your original cut marks to help you remove the baklawa pieces."]
