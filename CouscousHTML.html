        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>4 chicken thighs</p>
        <p>1 medium onion</p>
        <p>1/3 cup olive oil + 2 tbsp for the Couscous</p>
        <p>Water (1 liter or more for the sauce + 1/4 cup for the Couscous)</p>
        <p>1.5 tbsp tomato paste</p>
        <p>2 heaping tsp turmericy</p>
        <p>1.5 tsp chili flakes</p>
        <p>5-7 cloves of garlic</p>
        <p>Salt & pepper</p>
        <p>2/3 cup chickpeas</p>
        <p>1 large potato</p>
        <p>1 zucchini</p>
        <p>4 pieces of pumpkin</p>
        <p>5-7 cloves of garlic</p>
        <p>Salt & pepper</p>
        <p>1 pepper + 4 more fried for garnish (optional)</p>
        <p>2 cups Couscous</p>
           <br>
           <br>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>Prepare the Couscous Sauce:Start by cutting the onions into slices</p>
        <p>Add the onions to the bottom pot of the steamer with the olive oil, chickpeas, chicken thighs,</p>
        <p>the tomato paste, and the spices. Put on medium high heat and mix well until the chicken is well seasoned and the tomato paste is dissolved.</p>
        <p>You might need to add splashes of water for this step.</p>
        <p>Let it cook for 5-10 minutes then add the rest of the water.It should cover the chicken thighs.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, cut the vegetables into large chunks.</p>
        <p>Prepare the Couscous; while the sauce is boiling.</p>
        <p>place your Couscous in a large bowl. Drizzle olive oil and season with salt and mix it with your hands/fingers.</p>
        <p>Make sure that each small ball is coated with the oil.This makes the Couscous not stick together while steaming.</p>
        <p>Add approximately 1/4 cup of water and mix again. The couscous should be damp to the touch (not soaked).Set aside .</p>
        <p>Once the sauce has boiled for about 10-15 min, add the zucchini and pumpkin.</p>
        <p>Place the Couscous in the steamer pot on top of the sauce and let it steam for 20-30 min.</p>
        <p>Once all the vegetables and chicken are cooked, remove the Couscous and put it in a large bowl.</p>
        <p>Then, using the steamer pot, pour the sauce in it. This should separate the sauce and the vegetables.</p>
        <p>The sauce goes with the Couscous and the vegetables remain in the pot.Mix lightly with a large spoon then cover the bowl and let it sit for 5 minutes.</p>
        <p>Uncover, and mix again and see if more liquid needs to be added.</p>
        <p>I recommend you taste the Couscous for this step. Once it is ready, serve in a shallow bowl with a piece of chicken, pumpkin, a potato slice, carrots, zucchini, and a spoonful of chickpeas. You can top it off with a fried pepper.</p>
        <p>Serve hot and enjoy!</p>
        <p>TIP: this dish is paired perfectly with pomegranate seeds if you like sweet & savory pairings.</p>
