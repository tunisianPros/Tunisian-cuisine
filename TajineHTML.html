        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <p>1 lb chicken or lamb cut into small cubes about ¼ inch in size</p>
        <p>1 cup potato peeled and chopped into ¼ inch cubes</p>
        <p>¼ cup oil or enough to fully cover the bottom of your pots</p>
        <p>Water</p>
        <p>1 tbs ras el hanout spice mixture</p>
        <p>1 tsp tomato paste</p>
        <p>¼ tsp black pepper</p>
        <p>1 tsp salt</p>
        <p>¼ tsp cayenne powder</p>
        <p>1 tsp turmeric powder</p>
        <p>One bunch parsley one bunch very finely chopped</p>
        <p>1 cup frozen peas thawed</p>
        <p>8-10 Eggs</p>
        <p>⅓ cup dried bread crumbs</p>
        <p>½ cup cheese</p>
           <br>
           <br>
        <h3>Preparation:</h3>
        <p>Preheat your oven to 300 degrees F.</p>
        <p>In a small saucepan, add your oil, chicken, garlic and spice mixture, tomato paste, black pepper, salt,cayenne pepper, and turmeric.</p>
        <p>Cook on moderate heat for approximately a couple of minutes.</p>
        <p>Add enough water to cover the chicken, reduce the heat to low, cover and let simmer until the liquid has reduced </p>
        <p>by about ½ and the chicken is fully cooked.Set it aside and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>Note: By the end of cooking time for the chicken,it is ok and should look like there is more chicken than sauce.</p>
        <p>The sauce will be quite oily and this is what you want,</p>
        <p>so do not drain the oil as it is essential to the final outcome of the dish.</p>
        <p>Also, this is the only point to taste for salt/seasoning since later the mixture will have raw eggs.</p>
        <p>The sauce should be salty enough but try to avoid adding too much as the parmesan cheese will add a good amount of saltiness as well.</p>
        <p>In in small frying pan, fry your potatoes until just very lightly golden brown on the edges,the centers should still be pretty white.</p>
        <p>Set aside to cool on a paper towel lined plate. In a large bowl, whisk together 8 whole eggs.</p>
        <p>Add your parsley, potatoes, cheese, bread crumbs, and chicken mixture andgently fold all the ingredients together.</p>
        <p>Note: You are looking for a thick but still runny consistency.</p>
        <p>Similar to other quiches. If you find it’s too thick, feel free to whisk together one or two more eggs and add them to the mixture.</p>
        <p>If you find it is too runny, feel free to add in more bread crumbs just a spoonful at a time.</p>
        <p>With ours, we ended up adding two more eggs for a total of 10.</p>
        <p>Pour your mixture into a baking dish.</p>
        <p>Bake for 30-50 minutes or until the center has set and the edges are golden brown.</p>
        <p>Note: baking time will vary depending on your oven and the size of baking dish used.</p>
        <p>A square pan about 10x10 inches and 1-3 inches high is usually used to get the square tagine shape.</p>
        <p>A round pan, like the one we used is also fine but just keep in mind it will take longer to cookthe smaller the dish you use.</p>
        <p>Remove from oven and allow to cool.</p>
        <p>Cut into squares or any desired shape and serve.</p>
